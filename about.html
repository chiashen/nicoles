  <div class="topdiv-1">
  <p><span class="firstL">I</span> am a UX designer from Taiwan, now living in Australia. However, the truth is I have never thought of becoming a designer until recent years. For many years, I have always wanted to become  an interpreter, as a result of my love for the English language, and for many years, my ultimate pursuit had been becoming a conference interpreter for the United Nations. This is how I came to Australia after being accepted by the translating and interpreting master’s program at University of Queensland.</p>
  
  <p>And something changed after a semester of training. I realized that I didIn’t like the work style and work environment of an interpreter. All of a sudden, I arrived at a crossroad. The options I had were simple but yet difficult at the same time. I knew I could quit the program and just return home. Or, I could keep on studying, knowing that I would not end up working as an interpreter. Initially, I felt that I only had the two options, but very soon I decided to give myself a third one after attending an exhibition with student interaction design projects that were all fresh and new to  me. This is pretty much how I decided to change my major from interpreting to interaction design.</p>

  <p><span class="firstL">T</span>he decision I made was bold, I thought, as I had no background in the field at all. It may have seemed like a sudden decision, but I don’t regret it because interaction design changed my perception of the world, of the things people use in their daily lives, and most importantly, of the connection between humans and their artifacts. Many of my classmates were from related backgrounds including industrial design, information technology, computer science, and others. I would not say I was one of the best or that I had the best design skills because I am still learning. In fact, in the perspective of human-computer interaction (a core concept in this discipline), I believe people working in this field should always be learning new things because there will be more and more technologies. I wasn’t the best UI designer, but I had a lot of good ideas, as many student projects I have done in the past were based on my idea.</p>
  
  <p>Interaction design did not come into my life as I have planned. I am just a beginner in design, and it might sound like a cliche, but I have passion in interaction design.</p>
